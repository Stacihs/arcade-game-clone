# Arcade Game Clone
This is a project required for the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program. We were given the task of creating a browser arcade game clone. I built upon the basic html and CSS files that were given, by Udacity. I also had to edit the app.js file, to make the game functional.

## How to Play

#### Game Access

You can access this game by going to https://stacihs.github.io/arcade-game-clone/. The recommended browser for play is Google Chrome.

#### Rules of Play

The goal of this game is to move the player, to the water, without making contact with the ladybugs. If the player makes contact with a bug, the game resets. The arrow keys, on the user's keyboard, allow the user to move the player up, down, left and right. Once the player has reached the water, a modal will pop up asking if the user would like to play again.

## Resources

The font type comes from Google Fonts. Files containing the game engine and art assets were provided by Udacity.
